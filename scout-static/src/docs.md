## Design

examples we'd like the visual/aesthetic to aspire to:

- Landing pages:
  - http://invisionapp.com
  - http://electron.atom.io/ (more towards this)
  - https://www.cindori.org/software/disksensei/
- app ui:
  - https://mac.github.com/ (what we've been using as a primary comp. developer tool that tons of people already love that makes something really complicated like git seem easy to use)
  - however, because of our aesthetic and customers, https://windows.github.com is a better example
  - "anti-eclipse", "anti-robomongo"
  - soft, not a lot of gradient or borders, font that's the native default to the OS it's running on, simple, polished, doesn't feel like a toy, simple, clean, fast, efficient
  - Windows HIG https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/aa511258.aspx
  - Google HIG http://www.google.com/design/

- is a final name important for mdb world?
  - if it has a name, the demo is so much better because it ends with a link to a landing page so you can enter you email address and get contacted when it's available.  
  - showing it as "codename: scout" is fine
  - going to figure out how to loop them in first thing next week.  
  - they already have a little bit of context because we traded emails a few weeks ago re: customer profile research we could share

## Value Proposition

- > @todo: url to background slides on gdrive
- > @todo: url to customer profiles and summary of each
- > @todo: list of value props and summary for each
